      "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant performance gains via scaling up model sizes and/or data. However, recent evidence suggests diminishing returns from such approaches, motivating scaling the computation spent at inference time. Existing inference-time scaling methods, usually with reward models, cast the task as a search problem, which tends to be vulnerable to reward hacking as a consequence of approximation errors in reward models. In this paper, we instead cast inference-time scaling as a probabilistic inference task and leverage sampling-based techniques to explore the typical set of the state distribution of a state-space model with an approximate likelihood, rather than optimize for its mode directly. We propose a novel inference-time scaling approach by adapting particle-based Monte Carlo methods to this task. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our methods have a 4-16x better scaling rate over our deterministic search counterparts on various challenging mathematical reasoning tasks. Using our approach, we show that Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct can surpass GPT4o accuracy in only 4 rollouts, while Qwen2.5Math-7B-Instruct scales to o1 level accuracy in only 32 rollouts. Our work not only presents an effective method to inference-time scaling, but also connects the rich literature in probabilistic inference with inference-time scaling of LLMs to develop more robust algorithms in future work.

      "      How to aggregate the step-level rewards remains a choice when one uses PRMs. There are three common ways to assign rewards to a partial answer using PRMs: prod , which takes the product of rewards across all steps; min , which selects the minimum reward over all steps; and last , which uses the reward from the final step. Zhang et al. (2025b) studies the optimal way for reward aggregation and points out that the 'best choice' depends on if the PRM training data is prepared using MC rollout and/or human/model annotation. While prod aligns directly with the weight update rule described earlier, min and last do not allow for online weight updates. Therefore, for these methods, we compute the weight based on the entire partial trajectory instead.\n",
      "      Beyond these three approaches, we also explored a modelbased reward aggregation method that performed surprisingly well. This method feeds the PRM with partial answers but only considers the final reward token, effectively prompting the model to provide an aggregated reward for the partial answer. Interestingly, we tested the Qwen PRM both for its original purpose as a true process reward model and repurposed as an outcome reward model. When used as a true PRM, it receives the question and a list of steps generated by the policy model, calculates scores for each step and selects the last score-a practice introduced and evaluated in Beeching et al. (2024). As an ORM, the PRM takes in a question and a concatenated string of generated steps, producing a score that we convert into a weight for the resampling process. Appendix A.2 provides an illustration of how the two input formats are structured. We compare various reward models and evaluate all four aggregation strategies through an ablation study in Section 5.4.\n",
